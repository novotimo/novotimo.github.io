      <h2>What I do</h2>

      <p>
	I design and implement cryptographic systems that are secure by construction
	and practical to operate in real production environments.
      </p>
            <p>This typically involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modernizing cryptography in legacy systems (including post-quantum)</li>
                <li>Designing cryptographic systems such as MFA and key management systems with real threat models</li>
                <li>Debugging and extending OpenSSL-based systems</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>How I work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I start from your existing system, not an idealized redesign</li>
            <li>I prioritize compatibility, observability, and rollback paths</li>
            <li>I deliver working code and clear integration guidance</li>
            <li>I document assumptions and trade-offs, not just recommendations</li>

        <h2>Security first, compliance as a consequence</h2>
        <p>
            I work with organizations who need to meet standards such as PCI DSS or
            ISO 27001, but who understand that secure systems cannot be built by
            following checklists alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            My focus is on designing cryptographic and authentication systems that are
            correct, resilient, and maintainable—so that compliance requirements are
            satisfied as a consequence of good engineering, not in spite of it.
        </p>
	<p>
	    I have practical experience working in payment and card-processing
  	    environments, and understand how cryptographic design decisions affect audit
	    outcomes, operational risk, and incident response.

        <p>
            If you’re facing a cryptographic problem that’s too risky or complex to
            hand-wave, I’m happy to discuss whether I’m a good fit.
